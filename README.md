# Crypto Currency Web App

This web app is created in Python, and retrieves cryptocurrency prices for the top 100 cryptocurrency from the **CoinMarketCap**!

The following libraries are used:
* streamlit
* bs4
* requests
* json
* pandas
* base64

For web scraping, I have modified the code provided in [Web Scraping Crypto Prices With Python](https://tommycc.medium.com/web-scraping-crypto-prices-with-python-41072ea5b5bf)
